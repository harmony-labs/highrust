//! File Watcher Skeleton for HighRust CLI
//!
//! This module provides the scaffolding for a file watcher component
//! that will monitor source files and trigger transpilation when changes are detected.
//!
//! # Intended Usage
//! - The watcher will be started by the CLI (see `main.rs`).
//! - When fully implemented, it will watch for changes in source files and
//!   invoke the transpiler as needed.
//! - This is a skeleton; no actual file watching or transpilation logic is present yet.

use notify::{RecommendedWatcher, Result as NotifyResult, Watcher as NotifyWatcher, RecursiveMode, Event};

/// Struct representing the file watcher for the HighRust CLI.
pub struct Watcher {
    // The actual watcher will be stored here in the future.
    // watcher: RecommendedWatcher,
}

impl Watcher {
    /// Create a new file watcher.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `paths` - A list of paths to watch for changes.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// A new `Watcher` instance.
    pub fn new(/*paths: Vec<PathBuf>*/) -> Self {
        // Placeholder for future implementation.
        Watcher {
            // watcher: ...
        }
    }

    /// Start watching for file changes and trigger transpilation.
    ///
    /// This is a placeholder; no logic is implemented yet.
    pub fn watch(&mut self) -> NotifyResult<()> {
        // Placeholder for future implementation.
        Ok(())
    }
}

// Additional documentation:
// - When implemented, this module will use the `notify` crate to watch for file changes.
// - It will communicate with the transpiler to trigger recompilation as needed.
// - See `main.rs` for how to start the watcher from the CLI.
