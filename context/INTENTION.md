# HighRust Project Intention

HighRust exists to empower developers with a high-level, ergonomic dialect of Rust that maximizes productivity and code clarity while preserving the safety and performance guarantees that define Rust. The project's vision is to make full-stack development—across native, server, and WebAssembly (WASM) targets—faster, more accessible, and more enjoyable, without sacrificing the robustness and reliability of the Rust ecosystem.

## Purpose and Goals

HighRust is designed for developers who seek the power and safety of Rust, but desire a more expressive, less verbose, and more ergonomic experience for building modern applications. By abstracting away much of Rust’s explicitness (such as mutability, lifetimes, and low-level conversions) and providing progressive disclosure of advanced features, HighRust enables rapid prototyping and seamless code sharing across platforms.

The project’s primary goals are:
- To provide a high-level language that feels familiar to Rust developers, but with reduced boilerplate and increased expressiveness.
- To enable full-stack development with a single language, supporting native, server, and WASM targets.
- To maximize developer velocity and code quality through ergonomic syntax, safe defaults, and powerful tooling.
- To ensure all HighRust code is ultimately transpiled to idiomatic Rust, maintaining full compatibility with the Rust ecosystem.

## Target Users and Use Cases

HighRust is intended for:
- Application developers building cross-platform software (desktop, server, web via WASM).
- Teams seeking to unify their technology stack with a single, safe, and high-performance language.
- Rust enthusiasts who want to prototype and iterate quickly without losing access to Rust’s power.
- Educators and learners who want a gentler on-ramp to systems programming.

Key use cases include:
- Native applications with modern UIs.
- High-performance server-side services.
- Web applications leveraging WASM for near-native speed.
- Shared codebases between client and server.

## Relationship to Rust

HighRust is not a replacement for Rust, but an ergonomic dialect that transpiles to idiomatic Rust code. It is fully interoperable with the Rust ecosystem, allowing direct embedding and import of Rust code where needed. All safety guarantees of Rust are preserved by default, with escape hatches for advanced or low-level scenarios.

## Project Philosophy

- **Ergonomics First:** Minimize boilerplate and explicitness, surfacing complexity only when necessary.
- **Safety by Default:** All code is safe unless explicitly marked otherwise.
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Advanced features and low-level control are available but never forced.
- **Interop:** Seamless integration with Rust code and tooling.
- **Full-Stack Ready:** Designed for code sharing and productivity across all major platforms.

HighRust is community-driven, open source, and committed to fostering a productive, inclusive, and innovative environment for the next generation of full-stack systems development.
