# HighRust Project Plan

**Purpose:**  
This plan provides a high-level roadmap for the development and release of the HighRust language, transpiler, and ecosystem. It is intended as a reference for project leadership and engineering teams to guide implementation, set expectations, and align on success criteria.

---

## 1. Project Phases

### Phase 1: Core Transpiler MVP (4–8 weeks)
- Parsing, AST construction, and basic lowering.
- Initial .hrs to .rs code generation.
- Minimal CLI and file watcher.
- Foundational test suite.

### Phase 2: Ownership and Conversion Inference (8–12 weeks)
- Dataflow-based mutability, borrow, and clone inference.
- Automated conversions (e.g., .to_string(), Option/Result mapping).
- Full pattern matching support.
- Source mapping for diagnostics.

### Phase 3: Async, Polyfills, Build Integration (8 weeks)
- Complete async lowering and runtime support.
- Standard helper modules (map, filter, group-by, etc.).
- Integrated dev server, hot reload, and build pipelines (cargo, WASM).

### Phase 4: IDE Extensions, Plugin System, Community Release (Optional, 8+ weeks)
- Plugin hooks for syntax, type system, and codegen.
- External lints and formatters.
- Documentation, guides, example repositories, and community contribution resources.

## 2. Key Milestones

- **MVP Transpiler:** Basic .hrs to .rs conversion, minimal CLI, and test suite.
- **Ownership/Type Inference:** Ergonomic features, source mapping, and diagnostics.
- **Async & Polyfills:** End-to-end async support, helper libraries, and build integration.
- **Ecosystem & Community:** Plugin system, documentation, and open-source release.

---

## 3. Team & Timeline Guidance

- **Solo Developer:** Prototype achievable in 2–6 months.
- **Small Team:** Usable CLI expected in 3–12 months.
- **Production-Ready:** Full polish and ecosystem maturity may require multiple years.

---

## 4. Technical Challenges & Risks

- Achieving robust and flawless borrow/move/clone inference.
- Correctly lowering advanced type system features (ADTs, Option, Result, etc.).
- Expanding and supporting complex pattern matching.
- Translating async/await semantics and integrating runtime support.
- Ensuring seamless interop with standard Rust and embedded code blocks.
- Providing clear, actionable error mapping and diagnostics.

---

## 5. Success Criteria

- Over 98% of valid HighRust projects transpile to Rust that compiles with rustc.
- Transpilation time under 60 seconds for 100,000 lines of code in parallel mode.
- 100% test coverage for core syntax.
- All published bugs causing semantic loss are prioritized as critical (p0).
- Teams report measurable improvements in productivity and maintainability.
