# HighRust Implementation Roadmap

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2024-06-19  
**Owner:** HighRust Core Engineering

---

## 1. Overview

This roadmap outlines the phased implementation plan for the HighRust language, transpiler, and ecosystem. It is designed to guide engineering teams from MVP to production, ensuring maintainability, extensibility, and robust developer experience.

---

## 2. Phased Development Plan

### Phase 1: Core Transpiler MVP (4–8 weeks)
- Parse, AST, and basic lowering.
- Working codegen: .hrs → .rs (no advanced ergonomics yet).
- Minimal CLI and file watcher.
- Initial test suite (golden files, basic runtime tests).

### Phase 2: Ownership and Conversion Inference (8–12 weeks)
- Dataflow-based mut/borrow/clone inference.
- Insert .to_string(), Option/Result mapping.
- Full pattern matching support.
- Source mapping for diagnostics.

### Phase 3: Async, Polyfills, Build Integration (8 weeks)
- Full async lowering and runtime autonomy.
- Standard helper modules (map, filter, group-by, etc.).
- Dev server/hot reload, full cargo and WASM build pipelines.

### Phase 4: IDE Extensions, Plugin System, Community Release (Optional, 8+ weeks)
- Plugin hooks for syntax, type system, and codegen.
- External lints and formatters.
- Documentation, guides, example repo, and community contribution docs.

## 3. Key Milestones

- **MVP Transpiler:** Basic .hrs to .rs conversion, minimal CLI, and test suite.
- **Ownership/Type Inference:** Robust ergonomic features, source mapping, and diagnostics.
- **Async & Polyfills:** End-to-end async support, helper libraries, and build integration.
- **Ecosystem & Community:** Plugin system, documentation, and open-source release.

---

## 4. Team & Timeline

- **Solo Developer:** Prototype in 2–6 months.
- **Small Team:** Usable CLI in 3–12 months.
- **Production-Ready:** Multiple years for full polish and ecosystem maturity.

---

## 5. Checklist

- [ ] Formalize HighRust syntax/features.
- [ ] Build parser/AST.
- [ ] Implement semantics/type checking.
- [ ] Write transpiler to Rust.
- [ ] Add ergonomic inference (mut, clone, borrow, conversions).
- [ ] Publish CLI; add examples/tests.
- [ ] Grow features and community.

---

## 6. Technical Challenges

- Flawless borrow/move/clone inference.
- Type-system lowering (ADTs, Option, Result, etc.).
- Pattern-matching expansion.
- Async/await translation and runtime integration.
- Interop with normal Rust and embedded blocks.
- Error mapping and diagnostic clarity.

---

## 7. Inspirations & References

- Elm, TypeScript, ReasonML, Kotlin, Scala, Rescript, Sway, Swift, RustScript, Gut, Fe.

---

## 8. Success Criteria

- >98% of valid HighRust projects transpile to Rust that compiles with rustc.
- <60s transpile for 100kloc in parallel mode.
- 100% test coverage for core syntax.
- All published bugs causing semantic loss are prioritized p0.
- Teams report measurable productivity/maintainability improvements.
