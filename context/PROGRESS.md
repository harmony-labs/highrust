## Progress Checklist

### Phase 1: Core Transpiler MVP (100% Complete)

- [x] Implement parser for HighRust syntax
- [x] Build Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generation
- [x] Implement basic lowering from AST to intermediate representation
- [x] Develop working code generator: transpile .hrs files to .rs files
- [x] Create minimal CLI for transpilation
- [x] Implement file watcher for automatic transpilation
- [x] Develop initial test suite
  - [x] Add golden file tests
  - [x] Add basic runtime tests

#### Phase 1 Achievements
- Successfully implemented a parser using Pest for HighRust syntax
- Developed a comprehensive AST representation of HighRust language constructs
- Implemented lowering phase to transform HighRust AST to Rust-compatible IR
- Created code generator to produce idiomatic Rust code from IR
- Implemented function call statement support with proper syntax handling
- Built a CLI tool with file watching capabilities for seamless development
- Created test infrastructure including golden file tests and runtime tests
- Established robust test fixtures for basic language features validation

### Phase 2: Ownership and Conversion Inference (45% Complete)

- [~] Implement dataflow-based mutability, borrow, and clone inference
  - [x] Scaffold ownership inference system
  - [x] Implement mutability inference based on variable usage patterns
  - [x] Integrate mutability decisions into code generation
  - [~] Implement complete dataflow analysis for variable usage
  - [~] Implement borrow and move inference
- [ ] Insert .to_string() conversions where required
- [ ] Implement Option and Result type mapping
- [ ] Add full pattern matching support
- [ ] Implement source mapping for diagnostics

#### Phase 2 Achievements
- Created a new module (`ownership.rs`) for ownership inference
- Defined core data structures for tracking variable ownership, mutability, and lifetime information
- Implemented interfaces for ownership analysis of AST nodes
- Set up architecture for dataflow-based inference of move/borrow/clone semantics
- Integrated ownership inference into the transpiler pipeline
- Implemented mutability inference system to automatically determine when variables should be marked as `mut`
- Added dataflow analysis to track variable state changes through blocks and branches
- Enhanced lowering module to apply inferred mutability information when generating IR
- Added unit tests to verify mutability inference logic
- Implemented foundation for borrow inference system:
  - Added tracking for immutable and mutable borrows
  - Developed data structures to store borrow information in context
  - Created test cases for verifying borrow and move inference
  - Extended the code generation to support borrowing and moving semantics
  - Implemented special handling for method calls that should borrow their receiver

### Phase 3: Async, Polyfills, Build Integration

- [ ] Implement full async lowering and runtime autonomy
- [ ] Develop standard helper modules
  - [ ] Implement map helper
  - [ ] Implement filter helper
  - [ ] Implement group-by helper
  - [ ] Implement additional standard helpers as needed
- [ ] Develop development server with hot reload capability
- [ ] Integrate full cargo build pipeline
- [ ] Integrate full WASM build pipeline

### Phase 4: IDE Extensions, Plugin System, Community Release

- [ ] Implement plugin hooks for syntax extension
- [ ] Implement plugin hooks for type system extension
- [ ] Implement plugin hooks for code generation extension
- [ ] Add support for external lints
- [ ] Add support for external formatters
- [ ] Write documentation and guides
- [ ] Create example repository
- [ ] Write community contribution documentation
