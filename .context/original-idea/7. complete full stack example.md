Absolutely! Here’s a **vision** for the kind of build tool your fullstack HighRust ecosystem would ship with—let’s call it **`highrust`**. Unlike most JS/TS build tools, it would help you *compile, bundle, cross-target (native + WASM), and coordinate code-sharing* for a real-world, batteries-included experience.

## **highrust Build Tool: Overview**

The `highrust` CLI tool would handle:

- **Transpiling HighRust (`*.hrs`)** to ordinary Rust (`*.rs`)
- **Project scaffolding** (`highrust new`)
- **Dependency resolution** (using Cargo or a HighRust package index)
- **Building/serving** the server (native Rust)
- **Building/bundling** the client (WASM, with glue)
- **Codegen for shared DTOs/types**
- **Hot reload/dev server** for frontend
- **Cross-platform commands** for all of the above

---

## **Directory Structure Example**

```
my-fullstack-app/
├── client/
│   ├── ui.hrs
│   └── ...
├── server/
│   ├── main.hrs
│   └── ...
├── shared/
│   └── model.hrs
├── highrust.toml           # project config
└── Cargo.toml              # generated/managed
```

---

## **Example: `highrust.toml`**

```toml
[project]
name = "my-fullstack-app"
version = "0.1.0"

[entrypoints]
server = "server/main.hrs"
client = "client/ui.hrs"

[shared]
dirs = ["shared/"]
```

---

## **Common `highrust` CLI Commands**

```
highrust new my-fullstack-app   # Scaffold new app

highrust build                  # Build everything

highrust build --server         # Native build (transpile + cargo build)
highrust build --client         # WASM build (transpile + wasm-pack/trunk)

highrust dev                    # Dev mode: transpile, cargo run, wasm hot reload

highrust serve                  # Run full app in prod mode

highrust test                   # Run tests across all targets
```

---

## **Behind the Scenes: What’s the Tool Doing?**

1. **Transpile all `.hrs` files to Rust .rs:**
   - Shared types/tasks: single, canonical `.rs` generated for use on both sides
   - HighRust ergonomic features all “lowered” to Rust idioms

2. **Server build flow:**
   - Place transpiled server Rust in `server/target/`
   - Generate/update a `Cargo.toml` for server target
   - `cargo build` the native binary

3. **Client build flow:**
   - Place transpiled client Rust in `client/target/`
   - Generate/update a `Cargo.toml` with WASM dependencies
   - Use `wasm-pack build --target web` or [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/) for bundling and asset pipeline

4. **Serve/dev mode:**
   - Runs both the backend server (native Rust) and the frontend dev server (serving `index.html`, auto-injects rebuilt WASM bundle)
   - Watches `.hrs` files, re-transpiles and rebuilds as needed

5. **Shared types:**
   - Ensures models (DTOs, enums, etc.) are always in sync between client/server transpiled output

6. **Error mapping:**
   - On build/dev errors, prints both HighRust and corresponding Rust build diagnostics (ideally with line refs back to HighRust)

## **Sample Output Tree After Build**

```
my-fullstack-app/
├── server/
│   └── target/
│       ├── main.rs        # transpiled
│       ├── ...
│   └── Cargo.toml         # autogenerated
├── client/
│   └── target/
│       ├── ui.rs          # transpiled
│       ├── ...
│   └── pkg/               # WASM artifacts
│       ├── ui_bg.wasm
│       └── ui.js
├── shared/
│   └── model.rs           # transpiled
└── dist/
    ├── index.html
    ├── pkg/
    └── (other assets)
```

---

## **A Typical Workflow**

#### **Start coding:**
- Shared types & logic in `shared/`
- Web server/logic in `server/`
- Web UI in `client/`

#### **Live development:**
```sh
highrust dev
```
- Watches for changes
- Re-transpiles HighRust
- Rebuilds server binary (auto-restarts on change)
- Rebuilds WASM, reloads browser instantly

#### **Distribute:**
```sh
highrust build --release
```
- Compiles server-native & wasm-frontend optimized
- Bundles for deploy

---

## **A Simple Implementation Plan**

- **Phase 1:** Scaffold, transpile, build (MVP)
- **Phase 2:** WASM integration, hot reload, code-splitting
- **Phase 3:** Custom configs, plugin system, codegen, testing framework, error mapping, full-featured dev server

---

## **Comparison:**
- *Like* `create-react-app` + `cargo` + `wasm-pack` + `trunk` + type-safe code-sharing
- *But simpler!* Only work in HighRust unless "dropping down" to explicit Rust

---

## **Pseudocode for the Tool (in Rust/TS/python):**

```plaintext
for each .hrs in project:
    transpile to .rs
    place in appropriate target dir

if building server:
    generate server Cargo.toml
    cargo build

if building client:
    generate client Cargo.toml
    wasm-pack build --target web

if dev mode:
    watch .hrs files
    on change: transpile/rebuild/reload as needed
```

---

## **Conclusion**
- **You code in HighRust.**
- **You build/test/serve/run with `highrust`.**
- **You almost never touch `cargo`, `wasm-pack`, raw `.rs`, or asset bundlers directly.**
- **When needed, you drop into Rust in-place or as a module.**

---

**With a tool like this, HighRust would be uniquely positioned for REAL full stack Rust, with all the ergonomics of TypeScript’s ecosystem, but the power and performance of Rust/WASM.**
