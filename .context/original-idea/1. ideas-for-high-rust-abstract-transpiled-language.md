**Yes, it is *absolutely* possible to create a higher-level, more ergonomic language that compiles/transpiles to Rust, in the same way TypeScript enhances JavaScript or Kotlin/Scala enhance the JVM.**

Many people have discussed or prototyped variants of “higher-level Rust” (sometimes called “Rust++” or "RustScript"). The key challenges and opportunities for such a language are interesting to explore.

---

## 1. **Is it Possible?**

- **Yes:**  
  As with TypeScript → JavaScript, or Kotlin/Scala → JVM bytecode, you can design a language that:
    - Has a *superset* of Rust’s features
    - Hides difficult aspects such as explicit lifetime annotations, some borrow checker details, or verbose syntax
    - Offers ergonomics (optional GC, easier UI bindings, etc)
    - Compiles to standard Rust code, or even LLVM IR or WebAssembly via Rust

- **Proof of feasibility:**  
  - Elm → Compiles to JS, adds safety/functional features
  - ReasonML/Rescript → Compiles to JS, types from OCaml
  - TypeScript → Compiles to JS
  - Cython/Numba → Compile to C or Python or LLVM
  - Even C++/Rust to WebAssembly

## 2. **What Would It Look Like?**

### a) **Syntax & Semantics**

- **Syntax:**
    - Could look almost identical to Rust, *but*:
        - Reduce explicitness: `let x = foo();` without lifetime or mutability fuss
        - Automatic/reference-counted memory, unless opted-in to fine-grained borrowing/lifetimes (like TypeScript's `any`)
        - Easier async/await and Futures (higher-level abstractions hiding `Pin`/`Box`, etc)
        - Optional “automatic borrow checker” (compile-time or even runtime fallback for tricky cases)
        - Simpler trait bounds and less generics boilerplate (where possible)

- **Semantics:**
    - Default-to-safe, similar to Rust, but “escape hatches” for lower-level features
    - “Drop into raw Rust”: Mark a block as “raw rust” or “unsafe rust” for maximum control
    - Optional GC for some types (like Zig’s “comptime” and “runtime” allocations)

### b) **Features/Abstractions**

- Higher order functions, closures, async/await, sum types, pattern matching (same as Rust)
- **Implicit lifetimes:** Only surface them when absolutely necessary
- Safe mutability, “parametric drop” (structs drop their fields correctly, but with less explicit annotation)
- Automatic handling of some Rc/Arc or lifetime annotation, maybe via escape analysis
- Simple, familiar error handling (like TypeScript: `try`/`catch` can map to Result)

---

### c) **Tooling**

- **Transpiler/Compiler**  
    - The language would transpile to idiomatic Rust, which is then compiled by rustc to binary/WASM.
    - Source-maps or debuggability could be provided.

- **Interop**
    - You can import normal Rust code — escape hatches for performance, unsafe, etc.

---

### d) **Examples**

**Before (EasyRust, a “superset” language):**
```plaintext
fn fetch_users() => async [User] {
    let data = await http_get("/api/users");
    parse_users(data)
}
```

**After (Generated Rust):**
```rust
async fn fetch_users() -> Result<Vec<User>, SomeErrorType> {
    let data = http_get("/api/users").await?;
    let users = parse_users(data)?;
    Ok(users)
}
```

**Another Example (Implicit Lifetimes):**
```plaintext
fn foo(slice: &[u8]) -> &[u8] {
    // lifetime elision happens
}
```
But only show lifetimes if absolutely necessary.

## 4. **Challenges**

- Without a GC, hiding all borrow-checker/error propagation stuff is *hard* — but sometimes you can auto-insert Rc/Arc/Box or lower performance mode for ease of use.
- Rust’s performance is driven by explicitness — any “automatic” features may need runtime overhead (but you can often give the user a “manual override”!)
- Ergonomics may clash with safety; need clear escape hatches and diagnosis

---

## 5. **Summary**

A **TypeScript-for-Rust** is entirely possible, and would look like:
- A higher-level language, Rust-like, with default safety, but _less explicitness_
- More GC/managed options available by default, with “drop down” to full Rust for critical parts
- Transpiles to idiomatic Rust for final compilation
- Most Rust code can be imported directly (like `.ts` → `.js`)
- Built as an open-source experiment, could revolutionize “full stack Rust”

***This is a great idea. The only thing stopping mass adoption is the huge engineering effort to build a production-quality compiler and big enough ecosystem, but the concept is solid and has a ton of precedent in programming language history.***
