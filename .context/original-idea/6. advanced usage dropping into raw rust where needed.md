Great question—**the ability to drop from high-level ("HighRust") code into “real” Rust for maximal control is crucial** for power users, performance tuning, FFI, or cases where inference/sugar gets in the way.

Below, I provide an advanced example (with data-flow, async, custom types, etc) that shows:

- High-level ergonomic code in HighRust
- Explicit “drop to Rust” for part of a function, a polyfill, or a module
- Clear boundaries between the zones

---

## **Example: Web service with advanced features**

Suppose you’re writing a HighRust web service that:

- Handles async requests
- Does data fetching and transformation
- Uses “simple by default” HighRust, but optimizes a hot path with explicit Rust

#### **File: `service.hrs`**

```rust
// HighRust Area – Ergonomic and concise
data User = { id: u64, name: String, email: String }
data ApiError = { msg: String, code: u16 }

// Fun, high-level async: no lifetimes, mut, or clones!
async fn handle_request(req) -> Result<[User], ApiError> {
    let q = get_query_param(req, "limit") ?? "10"
    let limit = q.parse_int() ?? 10

    // Async HTTP, error and Option handled implicitly
    let users = await fetch_users(limit)?
    
    // Map/filter with ergonomic syntax
    let verified = filter(users, |u| u.email.ends_with("@example.com"))

    // Drop into Rust: Optimize sorting for large arrays
    let sorted = rust {
        // Full Rust follows here – can borrow/move/mutate/unsafe as needed.
        let mut v = verified.into_iter().collect::<Vec<_>>();
        v.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| a.name.cmp(&b.name));
        v // Return to HighRust as Vec<User>
    }

    Ok(sorted)
}

// Main loop, stays ergonomic
#[main] async fn main() {
    serve_requests(handle_request)
}
```

### **What’s happening here?**

- You write natural, high-level code for input/output, mapping, filtering, and error handling.
- When **performance or explicit resource control is needed**, you "drop into Rust" with a `rust { ... }` block (or an `@rust` annotation, etc. The exact mechanism is up to the language design).  
- Within a `rust` block, you write pure Rust: borrow, move, mutate, even use unsafe or FFI. Variables in scope (like `verified`) are made available appropriately (copied, moved, ref'ed, according to context).

---

## **Another Example: Custom Rust Module**

Suppose you write a custom, lower-level routine as its own Rust module, invoked from HighRust:

### **`util.rs`**
```rust
// Pure Rust, not HighRust—hand-crafted for perf
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn fast_hash(data: &str) -> u64 {
    // ... bitfiddling code ...
}
```
### **`main.hrs`**
```rust
// HighRust code
import rust "util.rs" // import pure rust function

fn print_hash(s: String) {
    let hash = fast_hash(s) // Calling the Rust function
    println("Hash: " + hash)
}
```

---

## **Possible Syntactic Mechanisms for "Dropping Down"**

1. **Block-level:**

   ```rust
   rust {
       // "Raw" Rust code here; HighRust variables bridged in/out as needed
   }
   ```

2. **Function-level annotation:**

   ```rust
   @rust
   fn complex_thing(params) { ... }
   ```

3. **Importing Rust files or inline modules:**

   ```rust
   import rust "mod.rs"
   ```

4. **"Escape hatches" for specific variables/expressions:**

   ```rust
   let result = rust!(unsafe { do_real_magic(&buffer) });
   ```

---

## **How is Data Shared?**

- The transpiler mediates: HighRust expressions/vars become Rust values at the drop-point.
- You might:
  - Pass variables **by reference** (for large data/collections)
  - Pass as **owned** values (when moving data)
  - Accept `unsafe` as needed (`rust { unsafe { ... } }`)
- HighRust-level errors and types are mapped for (de)serialization or direct use.

---

## **Advanced Example: Full Interplay**

```rust
// HighRust as default
data Packet = { src: String, dest: String, size: usize }

// Fallback for perf
fn batch_send(packets: [Packet]) -> usize {
    rust {
        use fastnet_sys::send_raw;

        let mut count = 0;
        for p in packets.iter() {  // We'll borrow from HighRust's Vec<Packet>
            // Do some bitpacking in raw Rust
            let bytes = format!("{}:{}:{}", p.src, p.dest, p.size).into_bytes();
            count += send_raw(&bytes);
        }
        count // Return value goes back to HighRust.
    }
}
```

## **Summary Table**

| Area            | Features Available                       | Restrictions        |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| HighRust        | Inferred clones/borrows, async, pattern, ergonomic sugar, ADTs | No explicit borrowing, fine-grained control, unsafe |
| `rust { ... }`  | All of Rust's power; lifetimes, mut, FFI, traits, unsafe | Must manage ownership, explicit types, mut, etc. |
| Import Rust     | Use Rust modules/functions for specialized code | Must ensure API compatibility/binding |

---

## **Summary**

- **Typical usage:** Use "HighRust" for 80–90% of app/business logic.  
- **Drop into Rust for:**  
  - Performance hot spots  
  - Platform/FFI integration  
  - Optimized data structures  
  - When you need explicit control (e.g., unsafe, tight loops, zero-allocation, etc.)
- **Boundaries are explicit/intentional** and well-understood in the codebase.

**This model gives you the best of both worlds:**  
*TypeScript-like dev experience* most of the time, plus *Rust's raw power* exactly where it matters.
