Typescript is amazing because it brings types and powerful features of better languages than javascript, to javascript.

Rust is an incredible language because its rich type system gives it the power of a garbage collected language, while remaining extremely performant and not requiring the overhead of a GC running in realtime.

Rust could be a dominant full stack language, if it just had an easier learning curve.

Would it be possible to create a higher level, slightly more abstracted language, which compiles or transpiles to rust (similar to how ts compiles to js, or .net languages transpile to MSIL), such that more engineers could more easily write frontend code in this slightly higher level rust, but drop down into full rust whenever necessary? Basically, this language would be a superset of rust, offering abstractions that hide some of the complexity of rust.

Would that be possible?

What would that look like?
