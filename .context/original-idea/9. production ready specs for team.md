Here’s a full, professional-level, production-quality specification for the HighRust-to-Rust transpiler, written as a document you’d actually hand your engineering team. This includes deliverables, philosophy, technical and operational requirements, architectural vision, extension points, QA, and developer ergonomics.

# **HighRust Transpiler Specification**

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2024-06-19  
**Owner:** HighRust Core Engineering  
**Stakeholders:** HighRust Language Devs, Fullstack Users, Rust Open Source Community

---

## **1. Executive Summary**

Build a production-grade transpiler that reliably and efficiently converts HighRust (a high-level, ergonomic Rust dialect) source code to standard, idiomatic Rust source code, supporting ergonomic coding across server, client, and WASM applications at TypeScript-like developer velocity and Rust’s safety/performance.  
Deliver maintainable code, extensible tooling, and excellent diagnostics from day 1.

---

## **2. Goals**

- **Ergonomic:** Let devs code Rust applications without daily concerns for clone, mut, lifetimes, or low-level conversions unless needed.
- **Compatible:** Output 100% valid, idiomatic Rust that builds using standard Cargo and Rust WASM toolchains.
- **Programmable:** Support segments of explicit Rust for fine control/edge cases (`rust { ... }`, module/function embedding).
- **Scalable:** Modular architecture, designed for progressive enhancement (new syntax, type features, plugins).
- **Developer-centric:** Inline source mappings, clear error diagnostics, robust command-line UX, auto-docs.
- **Full-stack story:** Allow cross-target deployment (native & wasm), code sharing, and end-to-end type sync.

---

## **3. Deliverables**

1. **Transpiler CLI:** `highrustc` (or `highrust transpile`) – converts .hrs (HighRust) files to .rs (Rust).
2. **Build Daemon/Dev Tooling:** Watches, (re-)builds, integrates smoothly with Cargo, wasm-pack, and trunk.
3. **Standard Library Polyfills:** For HighRust-specific iterations, group-by, safe Option/Result, async, etc.
4. **Error Reporting & Source Maps:** Track original source lines in errors and panics.
5. **Documentation Generation:** (`highrust doc`) - mirrors Rustdoc expectations.
6. **Comprehensive Test Suite:** Golden files, runtime integration tests, coverage.
7. **Contributor Guide:** Developer onboarding documentation.

---

## **4. Supported Language Features** _(initial targets, to be extended modularly)_

### 4.1 Syntax:

- Functions, async functions, struct-like `data` forms, enums, pattern matching, top-level code, module imports
- Loops, iterators, mapping/filter/group-by
- Ergonomic optionals, result types, propagation
- Implicit conversion, inferred borrow/mut/clone
- Explicit `rust { ... }` blocks, `@rust` functions, Rust module imports

### 4.2 Ergonomics

- No explicit `mut`, `clone`, `&`, lifetimes (unless inside explicit Rust)
- No forced `.to_string()`, literal conversions, newtype/casting for simple use
- No explicit Vec vs. slice for arrays, where it can be inferred

### 4.3 Async

- `async fn` → Rust async, auto-lowered `await`, `spawn`, main runtime
- Auto select runtime (tokio/async-std) or allow config

### 4.4 Pattern Matching

- List destructuring, default/guard cases, shorthands

### 4.5 Option/Result

- Sugars for nullables, try/catch blocks, early return propagation

### 4.6 Code Sharing

- Single canonical output for entity definitions used in both client (WASM) and server

### 4.7 Testing/Docs

- Doctest style built-in for functions, with CLI test runner
- Auto-generated module docs from comments

---

## **5. Architecture & Implementation Plan**

### 5.1 Pipeline Stages

1. **Source Loader**
   - Multi-file root resolution and inline mix

2. **Tokenizer/Lexer**
   - Custom lex spec, using [pest](https://pest.rs/) or [lalrpop]
   - k-token lookahead, good error recovery

3. **Parser**
   - Full production rules for HighRust
   - AST output
   - Robust position mapping for error/source maps

4. **Semantic Analyzer**
   - Variable, module, and import resolution (incl. shadowing and re-exports)
   - Type inference (Hindley-Milner, with escape hatches when needed)
   - Ownership/borrowing analyzer: usage passes for move/borrow/clone
   - Lifetime inference (only emitted in Rust if strictly necessary)
   - Detection of async or blocking context; error if rules violated
   - Trait/impl resolution and error reporting

5. **Desugaring/Lowering**
   - Expand module and pattern shorthands, group-by, filter, etc. to canonical IR
   - Lower async/await to Rust async
   - Lower try/catch and nullability to Option/Result forms

6. **Embed/Transplant Rust Blocks**
   - Inline explicit Rust code as block, function, or imported module
   - Bind HighRust vars as borrowed/owned as analysis dictates
   - Map errors to correct source

7. **Codegen**
   - Generate idiomatic .rs with no unnecessary boilerplate or generic bloat
   - Add explanatory comments for inferred mut, clones, etc (configurable)
   - Place files for cargo/wasm builds, generate Cargo manifests if needed

8. **Source Maps**
   - Inline .hrs:line to .rs:line, and maintain mapping for error diagnostics and panics

9. **Error/Warning Reporting**
   - Always point to original HighRust
   - Suggest fixes, especially for ambiguous clones/borrows or missing type hints

10. **CLI/Build Integration**
    - Cargo pipeline (modular output), WASM pipeline (wasm-pack/trunk/triple-check output)
    - Hot reload for dev
    - Print transpile & rustc (or wasm-pack) error side-by-side
    - Exits with correct codes for CI/CD

---

## **6. Key Engineering Requirements**

### 6.1 Performance
- Target: Transpile 10kloc/sec on bare metal, 2kloc/sec in dev/watch mode.

### 6.2 Determinism
- Output should be deterministic from given input and config; no non-deterministic reordering of code.

### 6.3 Modularity/Extensibility
- Language plugin API: Syntax, type-system, codegen extensions
- Custom lints, code formatting hooks (inspired by rustfmt/clippy, but for HighRust)

### 6.4 Interop
- Rust blocks run verbatim (possible variable binding helpers must be explicit)
- Type translation between HighRust and Rust must be bijective, with escape hatches

### 6.5 Fault Tolerance
- Fault-tolerant parse: recover enough of errorful files for IDE or dev server, even when not valid
- On failed transpile, full error context; stacktraces on panics

### 6.6 Testing
- Automated: golden test files, coverage, runtime tests (cargo, wasm)
- Manual: published example apps built/run/serving with CI

---

## **7. Development/Delivery Phases**

### Phase 1: Core Transpiler MVP (4–8 weeks)
- Parse, AST, basic lowering, working codegen, .hrs → .rs with no ergonomics yet
- Minimal CLI, simple file watcher
- First test suite

### Phase 2: Ownership and Conversion Inference (8–12 weeks)
- Dataflow-based mut/borrow/clone inference
- Insert .to_string(), Option/Result mapping
- Full pattern matching
- Source mapping

### Phase 3: Async, Polyfills, Build Integration (8 weeks)
- Full async lowering, runtime autonomy
- Standard helper modules map/filter/etc.
- Dev server/hot reload, full cargo and wasm build pipelines

### Phase 4: IDE Extensions, Plugin System, Community Release (Optional, 8+ weeks)
- Plugin hooks for syntax
- External lints, formatters
- Docs, guides, example repo, community contribution docs

---

## **8. Security and Compliance**

- All transpiled Rust must have no unsafe by default (except in explicit Rust blocks)
- Optionally, allow HighRust linter for forbidden constructs (as per Clippy/rustc lints)
- Sanitize embedded Rust blocks for suspicious patterns if security=’strict’ in config

---

## **9. Documentation & Developer Ergonomics**

- All error diagnostics must cite HighRust, not just line:col but also a code snippet
- `highrust doc` generates docs for all public items, autolinks to Rust docs where applicable
- Optional “verbose mode” for documenting what mut/clone/&/lifetime transformations transpiler made

---

## **10. Configuration**

### `highrust.toml`
- Entrypoints (server, client), include/exclude globs
- Standard lib toggles (e.g., enable polyfills)
- Output path overrides (default: sibling to .hrs source tree)
- Dependency overrides
- Plugin path list

---

## **11. Project Metrics/SLAs**

- >98% of all valid HighRust projects transpile to Rust that compiles with rustc nightly and stable
- <60s transpile for 100kloc project in parallel mode
- 100% test coverage for core syntax, output matches golden files
- All published bugs that cause loss of semantic fidelity are prioritized p0

---

## **12. Non-Goals/Later Phases**

- Directly transpiling to binaries/bytecode (always to Rust)
- AST-level transformation plugins (can plan for but not deliver at v1)
- Compilation of procedural macros in HighRust (phase 2+)
- Language server/IDE plugin

---

## **13. Risks & Mitigations**

- **Complex clone/ownership inference**: Conservative (safe) by default, fallback to "over-clone" and guide user to drop to Rust when performance critical
- **Error reporting complexity**: Always show HighRust and generated Rust in errors; build robust source maps early
- **Cargo/build pipeline churn**: Stay as close to vanilla Rust build infrastructure as possible, avoid custom build runners unless strictly needed

---

## **14. Success Criteria**

- Users can build, run, and debug real apps in HighRust with ergonomic semantics, only needing Rust for edge/performance cases
- All errors are actionable, clear, and cite source
- Output is idiomatic, readable, and debuggable Rust
- Teams report productivity/maintainability improvements over baseline Rust (to be measured in user studies)

---

## **15. Open Questions**

- How best to offer mutability/borrowing hints to users (comments, output, or lints)?
- Which async runtime to default to for the first version, and how to allow opt-in/override?
- Should there be strict/dynamic modes (e.g., stricter on clone/borrow) as a build option?
- What’s the best model for embedded/external Rust code? (Separate file or inline? How to handle binding?)
