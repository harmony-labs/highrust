Absolutely! Here is a **detailed specification** for creating a HighRust-to-Rust transpiler, in the style of a language/reference implementation design doc. This is focused on an MVP that can gradually be extended.

---

# **HighRust-to-Rust Transpiler: Detailed Specification**

## **I. Scope and Scope Boundaries**

The transpiler's job is to:
- Transform valid HighRust (.hrs) code into semantically equivalent Rust code;
- Lower away HighRust's ergonomic and inferred features (no explicit mut/clone/&/lifetimes/type-boilerplate/etc.);
- Enable fallback to explicit, embedded Rust;
- Output Rust code ready for `cargo` and WASM compilation.

**Out of scope for v1**: full IDE integration, procedural macros, async trait lowering, full type inference.

---

## **II. Compiler Phases**

1. **Lexing & Parsing**
2. **AST Construction**
3. **Semantic Analysis & Type Checking**
4. **Desugaring to Core IR**
5. **Code Generation (to Rust AST or Rust source)**
6. **Error Reporting and Source Maps**

---

## **III. Language Features and Handling**

### 1. **Core Syntax (Subset/superset of Rust)**

- Function definitions (without explicit mut/lifetime/trait bounds)
- Structs and Enums via `data`
- Pattern matching; variant dispatch
- Async/await (no lifetime headaches)
- Loops: `for`, `while`
- Top-level (module-scope) code
- Imports/exports
- Embedded Rust escapes: `rust { ... }`, `@rust` functions

### 2. **Inferred and Ergonomic Conversions**

| HighRust Feature    | Rust Output                        | Transpiler Behavior                                         |
|---------------------|----------------------              |------------------------------------------------------------|
| No `mut`            | Add `mut` as needed                | Dataflow/usage analysis                                    |
| No `clone()`        | Insert `.clone()` if required      | Ownership/borrow analysis                                  |
| No `&`/borrows      | Insert refs as needed              | Dataflow/type context                                      |
| No `.to_string()`   | Add for literals in func/field use | Context/type-driven                                        |
| Arrays `[T]`        | `Vec<T>` or slice `&[T]`           | Analyze context                                            |
| Nullables/optionals | Rust's `Option<T>`                | `null` ⇄ `None`, auto-wrap/unwrap                         |
| Result type         | Rust's `Result<T, E>`             | Error-propagation lowering; `try`/`catch` etc.             |
| Pattern matching    | Use `match` or lower to ifs        | Expand shorthands (list/struct destructuring, guards, etc) |

**All of this requires context-aware transformations, not just syntax!**

### 3. **Shared Types**

- Types in `shared/` transpile identically for both WASM and native builds so wire data is always compatible.
- Tagged enums/lists understood as Rust sum types/Vectors.

### 4. **Async Handling**

- `async fn` and `await` mapped to Rust's async model
- Non-async contexts flagged as error when `await` present
- Optional: allow "blocking async" via spawn or runtime detection

### 5. **Interop/Escape Hatches**

- Blocks: `rust { ... }` passes through Rust verbatim, in place; can reference previous vars (as owned, ref, or clone according to analysis).
- Functions: `@rust` functions not transpiled, included verbatim.
- Module imports: `import rust "foo.rs"` wires external Rust modules.

---

## **IV. Transpiler Workflow**

1. **Source Expansion**
   - Import all HighRust sources (resolving imports/includes).

2. **Tokenization and Parsing**
   - Use a Rust parsing framework such as [pest](https://pest.rs/) or [lalrpop](https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop).
   - Produce an AST deeply inspired by Rust's, but less explicit.

3. **Semantic Phase**
   - **Type Inference Engine**
     - Adopt a Hindley-Milner-like type inference for variables/functions.
     - Devise a conservative "clone if reused after move" rule.
   - **Ownership Resolution**
     - Analyze for move/borrow/clone requirements using use-after-move and context analysis (e.g., does this array get reused?).
   - **Pattern Lowering**
     - Turn list/struct destructuring into valid Rust matches/splits.
   - **Sugar Expansion**
     - For user-friendly iterators/map/filter/group/find, either inline as Rust code or call helper functions from a stdlib.

4. **Rust Code Generation**
   - Walk the IR and emit idiomatic, human-readable Rust code.
   - Annotate with comments marking derived constructs for debugging.
   - For `rust { ... }`, emit verbatim in the equivalent block.

5. **Source Map Generation**
   - Track file/line offsets from HighRust to Rust for debugging.

6. **Write Out**
   - Output `.rs` files to appropriate target folders for use with Cargo/WASM.

---

## **V. Type System**

- Most types inferred; user may annotate explicitly for clarity.
- Generics supported only as far as Rust’s type model, inferred where possible.
- Lifetimes only added to Rust output if required by the borrow checker.

---

## **VI. Error Handling**

- Compile-time errors:
  - Parsing: Unambiguous and friendly—e.g., “expected : after field name.”
  - Type: Prescriptive—e.g., “Cannot infer if `foo` should be cloned. Consider using @rust block.”
- Runtime errors: No effect at transpile stage; runtime handled by Rust.

---

## **VII. Standard Library/Helpers**

- Bundled helpers for group_by, map, filter, etc. as Rust modules.
- Optionally, allow users to write HighRust polyfills or use crate imports directly.

---

## **VIII. Testing and Validation**

- Golden files: Each `.hrs` translated to `.rs` output; output runs under `rustc` or `cargo test`.
- Runtime samples: server & wasm app test harnesses for end-to-end checks.

---

## **IX. CLI Options (`highrustc` or `highrust transpile`)**

- `--input foo.hrs`
- `--output foo.rs` (or target dir)
- `--source-map`
- `--strict` (fail on ambiguous clones/borrows)
- `--no-std` (bare output for embedded/wasm)

---

## **X. Future-Proofing**

- Modular design for plugging in advanced features:
    - Macro expander (HighRust macros → Rust macros or code)
    - Plugin hooks for custom DSL or codegen
    - Integration of rust-analyzer for better diagnostics
- Configurable strictness (TS-style: pedantic or pragmatic)

---

## **XI. Implementation Plan (Summary)**

1. **MVP**
    - Handle function/struct/enum transpile, basic statements/expressions
    - Insert mut, clone, to_string as needed; default to over-cloning
    - Output working Rust

2. **Basic analysis & error reporting**
    - Ownership/borrows tracked
    - Warnings for “inefficient” constructs

3. **Sugary features**
    - Async, result/option, map/filter, pattern matching, simple imports

4. **Escape hatch (`rust { }`)**
    - Working, stable, data walled to prevent accidental sharing glitches

5. **Build/Integration**
    - Write Cargo.toml/autogen for native & WASM as needed
    - Shared code autodetection and cross-compilation

6. **Advanced features**
    - Typeclasses/traits, macros, plugin API

---

## **XII. Example: Translating a Real Function**

### **HighRust:**
```rust
fn first_uppercase(names: [String]) -> String {
    for name in names {
        if name[0].is_uppercase() {
            return name
        }
    }
    return ""
}
```

### **Transpiled Rust:**
```rust
fn first_uppercase(names: Vec<String>) -> String {
    for name in names.iter() {
        if let Some(c) = name.chars().next() {
            if c.is_uppercase() {
                return name.clone();
            }
        }
    }
    String::new()
}
```

---

## **XIII. Technical Choices**

- **Rust** for transpiler implementation (max control, best performance)
- **pest/lalrpop** for parser, good error messages
- **`syn` crate** for Rust codegen, or direct string-building for MVP
- Modular, test-driven development (`golden` files for output)

---

## **XIV. Open Questions for Iteration**

- How to generalize and document ownership analysis for contributors?
- Configurability for advanced Rust devs (opt-in for explicit borrows)
- How far should error reporting push HighRust errors forward (rather than Rust backend errors)?
- Most ergonomic syntax for Rust escape hatches.

---

# **Appendix: MVP Deliverable**

- Transpiler binary: `highrustc` or `highrust transpile`
- Converts `.hrs → .rs`
- Handles core ergonomic features
- Source/line mappings for debugging
- Suite of test cases (input HighRust, output Rust, expected program behavior)

**With these specs, a small team (or motivated engineer) can build the first working version and rapidly iterate.**  
Would you like a breakdown of how to approach each compiler phase, or a sample module for one stage (like “ownership analysis” or “async lowering”)?
